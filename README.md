This analysis explores socioeconomic and environmental conditions in Dallas, Texas, through spatial mapping and data visualization. Using data from mySidewalk and EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), various indicators such as median household income, unemployment rates, racial demographics, proximity to healthy food, and traffic volume were mapped.

Key findings include:

1. **TRI Facility Density:**
   - TRI facilities are unevenly distributed, with higher densities observed in census tracts that also exhibit lower median household incomes and higher percentages of minority populations, especially Hispanic and Black communities.

2. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - Analysis of vulnerable locations, specifically K-12 public schools, revealed multiple schools situated within a half-mile and one-mile radius of TRI sites. This proximity highlights potential health risks to sensitive populations, such as children.

3. **Demographic Insights:**
   - Census tracts with higher concentrations of TRI facilities generally correlate with lower-income levels and higher percentages of Hispanic and Black residents, indicating environmental justice concerns.

Interactive and thematic maps effectively visualize these relationships, emphasizing areas that may require targeted policy interventions to mitigate environmental risks and improve socioeconomic conditions.
